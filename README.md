# MVP-discuss
A place to design a proof of concept implementation of Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks. (For what that is, see xxx.)

To prove the concept, an implementation of it has to be useful -- it should be a "minimum viable product". 

This repo is for discussing (in the issues and wiki) what that product might be and how to implement it. 

There is not only one answer to that, so this repo is not for coding a product -- new coding projects will get their own repos. (The first coding project might well not end up being considered the "main" one, so we don't even want to try coding the first one in this repo.)

TEMPORARY additional comments:

This repo is intended to start out copying the content (including issues) of another one, oresmus/OPSN. Once we copy over the readme and the initial description of each issue, we'll switch over to using this one for everything new. (I'm not sure about the existing 7 issues, depends on whether we're too lazy to copy an approximation of their comment threads. But we'll at least create them here, so they have the same issue numbers and titles.)

After this one gets cleaned up and stabilized enough for new issues and comments, we can announce it to the G+ community related to OPSN.

# MVP-discuss
A place to design a proof-of-concept implementation of Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks. (For what that is, see below.)

To prove the concept, an implementation of it has to be useful -- it should be a "minimum viable product" (MVP). 

This repo is for discussing what that product might be and how to implement it. (The discussion is mostly in github issues, though when things seem more like "proposed internal documentation" they can be added as "source files" in this repo. Note that github doesn't list contributors on the repo as a whole if they only comment on issues, so there might be more contributors in reality than the ones listed for this repo.)

There is not only one answer to that question (about the choice of MVP), so this repo is not for coding a product -- new coding projects will get their own repos. (The first coding project might well not end up being considered the "main" one, so we don't even want to try coding the first one in this repo.)

## Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks (OPSN)

"Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks" refers to a software system that allows people to capture the ideas and arguments in their discussions into a "graph of all ideas", in which every comment or larger document can be linked to everything it's related to, and archived permanently in a decentralized way (with everyone archiving the parts they're most interested in).

For a general description, read my blog post "[a Social Network for Ideas](http://oresmus.github.io/blog/2015/09/21/social-net-for-ideas.html)". For a high-level but technical overview of how it could be implemented, read the followup post "[Extensible Meaning in a Shared Cloud](http://oresmus.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/OPSN-data-formats.html)".

Other places which have relevant discussion include the Google+ posts linked from the two blog posts above, the Google+ community about "collaborative design", and another github wiki linked from my blog's About page. (xxx add links)

## this repository

For the time being, this repository can serve as a place to discuss an initial "proof of concept" implementation of OPSN. We can try to follow the community-building suggestions in the fascinating book [xxx](xxx). This means we can create github issues (starting with "that initial implementation doesn't yet exist") and use them to discuss how we might solve them.

(Once we're actually building software, we'll do that in other repos and link to them from here.)

Note that everything contributed to this repo falls under the **Apache license**, version 2.0. In particular, that means that **if you suggest any ideas** in this repository, **you're granting everyone the right** to use any patents you might own, now or in the future, which are necessary for practicing those ideas. (Or at least that's how I understand it -- correct me if I'm wrong! And if I'm wrong, then I'm hereby adding that condition to this repo's license.)

## TODO

- When it would be useful, announce this repo (and its github organization) to the G+ community related to OPSN.

- Decide whether we should be using github projects and wiki pages, instead of issues, for some of this design discussion.

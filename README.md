# MVP-discuss
A place to design a proof of concept implementation of Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks. (For what that is, see xxx.)

To prove the concept, an implementation of it has to be useful -- it should be a "minimum viable product". 

This repo is for discussing (in the issues and wiki) what that product might be and how to implement it. 

There is not only one answer to that, so this repo is not for coding a product -- new coding projects will get their own repos. (The first coding project might well not end up being considered the "main" one, so we don't even want to try coding the first one in this repo.)

TEMPORARY additional comments:

This repo is intended to start out copying the content (including issues) of another one, oresmus/OPSN. Once we copy over the readme and the initial description of each issue, we'll switch over to using this one for everything new. (I'm not sure about the existing 7 issues, depends on whether we're too lazy to copy an approximation of their comment threads. But we'll at least create them here, so they have the same issue numbers and titles.)

After this one gets cleaned up and stabilized enough for new issues and comments, we can announce it to the G+ community related to OPSN.

COPY OF ORIGINAL README:

# OPSN
A place to design a proof of concept implementation of Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks.

"Overlaid Personal Semantic Networks" refers to a software system that allows people to capture the ideas and arguments in their discussions into a "graph of all ideas", in which every comment or larger document can be linked to everything it's related to, and archived permanently in a decentralized way (with everyone archiving the parts they're most interested in).

For a general description, read my blog post "[a Social Network for Ideas](http://oresmus.github.io/blog/2015/09/21/social-net-for-ideas.html)". For a high-level but technical overview of how it could be implemented, read the followup post "[Extensible Meaning in a Shared Cloud](http://oresmus.github.io/blog/2015/11/10/OPSN-data-formats.html)".

For the time being, this repository can serve as a place to discuss an initial "proof of concept" implementation of OPSN. We can try to follow the community-building suggestions in the fascinating book [xxx](xxx). This means we can create github issues (starting with that implementation not yet existing) and use them to discuss how we might solve them.

(Once we're actually building software, we'll probably do that in other repos and link to them from here.)

Note that everything contributed to this repo falls under the Apache license, version 2.0. In particular, that means that if you suggest any ideas in this repository, you're granting everyone the right to use any patents you might own, now or in the future, which are necessary for practicing those ideas. (Or at least that's how I understand it -- correct me if I'm wrong! And if I'm wrong, then I'm hereby adding that condition to this repo's license.)
